# Binary Tree Depth Checker

This C++ program is designed to find the maximum depth of a binary tree. The binary tree is hard-coded in the `createTree()` function, and the structure of the tree is as follows:

             1
            / \
           2   3
          / \   \
         4   5   6
            /   / \
           7   8   9
           \
            10
